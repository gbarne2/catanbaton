//this will be the main game file for the client side, other than for the GUI. for now, this will be the text user interface.

//need to be able to do the following
/*
-Call function to setup client and host server stuff to run on local host
-Init game
-request current # cards from server
-request board info from server
-build roads
-build settlement
-build cities (when allowed)
-perform initial placement
-trade with player (need to get other stuff working well first, and need to have 2 clients for this?)
-buy DV card (not implemented yet)
-place robber and steal card from player
-start turn
-end turn

*/

//Plan of action
/*
-Get client side control done first, verify code with the strings that would be sent to the server.
-Get client - server interface working
-get gui running
